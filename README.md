Study of the relation between Halo Mass Function and Luminosity Function of galaxies at z=6


First Part

1) Halo Mass Function from database           ok

2) Luminosity as function of DM Halo Mass     ok

3) Magnitude as function of Luminosity        ok

4) Luminosity Function                        ok 

5) Plotting observational data vs results


Second Part

1) Adjust parameters to obtain the relation between DM halo mass and luminosity function. (Via Montecarlo?)
